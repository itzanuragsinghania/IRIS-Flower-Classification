## Introduction

This Web Application powered by Machine Learning and Flask focusses on bringing every aspect of Iris Flower classification together. <b>Iris Flower Classification project</b> is one of the most basic projects in ML used to get a better understanding of data and how ML models work. This project tries to bring the data description, EDA, ML models performance and finally prediction model all under one roof.</b>
